This repository is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository. This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the Spring 2023 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science. Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
